Code for my Raspberry Pi Zero/ Unicorn-hat based "glow jar" (all hail the glow jar) to glow with appropriate
colours for the weather outside. From blue (-10 and below) to white to green to yellow to red (30 +).
The jar uses the MET Office's Weather API to get the latest temperature measurements from a 
weather station at Andrew's Field (a few miles away from Cambridge, the closest one to me).
